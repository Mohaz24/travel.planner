# Capstone 
# Summary
Project contains of all the things we have learned through out the course.

In addition adding time, date and temperature is all part of the requirements. lastly,a entry must be created where a user enters the form and the results should be displaying when, where the person is travelling to such as city, weather and the date their leaving.
